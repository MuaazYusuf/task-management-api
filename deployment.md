# Task Management API - Architecture and Deployment

## Architecture Overview

The Task Management API is designed with a clean architecture approach to separate concerns and promote maintainability. The system consists of the following key components:

### 1. Core Architecture

The core architecture consists of the following layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains business entities, interfaces, and business logic
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Implements data access and external service integrations
- **Application/Service Layer**: Orchestrates use cases and business flows
- **API Layer**: Handles HTTP requests, validation, and responses

### 2. Key Design Patterns

- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data access operations
- **Dependency Injection**: Reduces coupling between components
- **Unit of Work**: Manages transactions and data consistency
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates complex objects
- **Observer Pattern**: Handles event-driven notifications
- **Strategy Pattern**: Implements different authentication strategies
- **Decorator Pattern**: Extends functionality with cross-cutting concerns

### 3. Database Schema

The system uses MongoDB as its primary database with the following collections:

- **Users**: Store user account information
- **Tasks**: Store task details
- **Task History**: Store audit logs for task changes
- **Task Comments**: Store comments on tasks
- **Notifications**: Store user notifications
- **User Tasks**: Handle many-to-many relationships between users and tasks

### 4. Key Features

- **JWT Authentication with Refresh Tokens**: Secures the API
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Controls access to resources based on user roles
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Uses message queues for asynchronous processing
- **Caching Strategy**: Improves performance by caching frequent queries
- **Background Job Processing**: Handles non-critical operations asynchronously

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment architecture consists of the following components:

### 1. AWS Deployment

The application is deployed on AWS using the following services:

- **ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: Hosts the application containers
- **ECR (Elastic Container Registry)**: Stores Docker images
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Provides managed MongoDB database service
- **ElastiCache**: Provides managed Redis cache
- **Amazon MQ**: Provides managed RabbitMQ message broker
- **CloudWatch**: Provides monitoring and logging
- **Application Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic to the application

### 2. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

The CI/CD pipeline is implemented using GitHub Actions:

1. **Test Stage**:
   - Code Linting

2. **Build Stage**:
   - Create production build
   - Build Docker image

3. **Deploy Stage**:
   - Push Docker image to ECR
   - Update ECS service

### 3. Scalability and High Availability

- **Auto Scaling**: ECS service scales based on CPU/memory usage
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: Services are deployed across multiple availability zones
- **Database Replication**: MongoDB Atlas provides auto-scaling and replication

### 4. Security Measures

- **JWT Authentication**: Secures API endpoints
- **RBAC**: Restricts access based on user roles
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse of the API
- **Input Validation**: Ensures data integrity
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive data in transit and at rest
- **Network Security**: VPC with private subnets for internal services

### 5. Monitoring and Logging

- **CloudWatch Metrics**: Monitors system performance
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Centralized logging
- **X-Ray**: Distributed tracing for request flows
- **Alarms**: Configured for critical metrics

### 6. Disaster Recovery

- **Regular Backups**: Automated database backups
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform templates for infrastructure provisioning
- **Cross-Region Replication**: For critical data

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Database Optimization

- **Indexing Strategy**: Indexes implemented on frequently queried fields
- **Aggregation Pipelines**: Used for complex queries
- **Document Structure**: Designed for query patterns
- **Caching**: Implemented for frequently accessed data

### 2. Caching Strategy

- **Cache Aside Pattern**: For read-heavy operations
- **Time-Based Invalidation**: For data with predictable freshness
- **Event-Based Invalidation**: For data modified through write operations

### 3. Query Optimization

The following optimized queries are implemented:

#### Get Tasks Assigned to a User (Paginated & Filtered)
```javascript
// Implemented in TaskRepository.findTasksForUser method
```

#### Get Task Full History
```javascript
// Implemented in TaskHistoryRepository.findTaskHistory method
```

#### Get Users Who Interacted with a Task
```javascript
// Implemented via TaskHistory and TaskComment collections
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns
2. **Repository Pattern**: Data access abstraction
3. **Dependency Injection**: Loose coupling
4. **Error Handling**: Consistent error responses
5. **Validation**: Input validation using Zod
6. **Logging**: Structured logging
7. **Documentation**: API documentation
8. **Security**: JWT, RBAC, Rate limiting
9. **Performance Optimization**: Caching, indexing
